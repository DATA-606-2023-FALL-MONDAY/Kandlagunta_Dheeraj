## Model Training and Development

### Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment analysis is a crucial part of the Yelp Explorer project, aiming to understand and quantify the emotions expressed in Yelp reviews. This process involves analyzing text data from reviews to classify sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral. 

#### Methodology

The project employs two popular sentiment analysis tools: TextBlob and VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner). 

- **TextBlob**: This tool is used for its simplicity and effectiveness in calculating both polarity and subjectivity of the text. 
   - **Polarity**: It ranges from -1 (highly negative) to +1 (highly positive), indicating the emotional leaning of the text.
   - **Subjectivity**: It measures the degree of personal opinion and factual information in the text, ranging from 0 (objective) to 1 (subjective).

- **VADER**: Particularly suited for social media text, VADER complements TextBlob by providing nuanced sentiment scores, including a compound score that combines positivity, negativity, and neutrality scores of the text. The compound score normalizes the cumulative sentiment score to lie between -1 (extremely negative) and +1 (extremely positive).

#### Application in the Project

1. **Calculating Prime Score**: The project introduces a novel metric called 'Prime Score' for each review. This score is an amalgamation of the star rating provided by the user and the sentiment scores obtained from TextBlob and VADER. 
   - The formula used is: **Prime Score = Star Rating + (Polarity Score x Compound Score)**.
   - This composite score aims to provide a more holistic view of a user's opinion, combining their explicit rating with the implicit sentiment of their review.

2. **Enhancing Recommendation Systems**: 
   - The Prime Score is used to refine the recommendation systems. By incorporating sentiment analysis, the project goes beyond mere star ratings, ensuring that the recommendations are not just based on popularity but also on the quality of experiences as expressed in the reviews.
   - This approach is particularly beneficial in distinguishing between restaurants that have the same star rating but different sentiment scores in their reviews.

#### Why Sentiment Analysis?

- **Depth of Analysis**: Sentiment analysis allows for a deeper understanding of user reviews, capturing nuances that simple star ratings cannot.
- **Personalization**: By analyzing sentiments, the project can better tailor recommendations to users, aligning suggestions with users' emotional responses rather than just quantitative ratings.
- **Handling Subjectivity**: The subjectivity score from TextBlob helps in identifying reviews that are more opinion-based versus those that are factual, adding another layer to the analysis.

#### Usage in Further Analysis

- The sentiment scores and the Prime Score play a crucial role in the subsequent stages of the project, especially in the collaborative filtering and content-based recommendation systems.
- These scores help in identifying restaurants that not only are highly rated but also elicit positive emotional responses from patrons, thus enhancing the overall user experience with the Yelp Explorer tool.

### Topic Modeling

Topic Modeling is a vital component of the Yelp Explorer project, aimed at uncovering underlying themes or topics present in the vast collection of Yelp reviews. This technique enables the discovery of hidden semantic structures in text data, which are not immediately apparent.

#### Implementation of Topic Modeling

- **Methodology**: The project utilizes Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a popular probabilistic topic model that assumes documents are mixtures of topics and topics are mixtures of words. This method helps in categorizing text within a document into specific topics, based on the frequency of words.

- **Preprocessing**: The raw text data undergoes several preprocessing steps before topic modeling. This includes:
  - Tokenization: Splitting text into individual words.
  - Stopword Removal: Eliminating common words that add little value in the analysis.
  - Lemmatization: Reducing words to their base or root form.

- **Model Training**: The LDA model is trained on the preprocessed text data. The number of topics is a parameter that can be tuned, and for this project, a specific number of topics were chosen based on trial and error or model coherence scores.

#### Purpose and Application

- **Discovering Patterns**: Topic modeling is used to identify and quantify patterns in the themes of Yelp reviews, providing insights into the most discussed aspects of restaurants, like food quality, service, ambiance, etc.

- **Enhancing User Experience**: The identified topics help in enhancing user experience by allowing potential customers to quickly understand the most prominent features or opinions about a restaurant.

- **Informing Business Owners**: This analysis can also be beneficial for restaurant owners to understand customer sentiment and areas of improvement or strength.

#### Why Topic Modeling?

- **Deeper Insights into Customer Reviews**: Unlike simple sentiment analysis, topic modeling provides a more granular view of the content of reviews, helping to understand what specific aspects of a restaurant customers are talking about.

- **Data-driven Decision Making**: It aids in making data-driven decisions for both users and business owners by highlighting key areas of interest or concern in customer reviews.

- **Content Categorization**: Helps in categorizing the content of reviews into coherent topics, which can be used for summarizing large volumes of text data efficiently.

#### Usage in Further Analysis

- **Content-Based Recommendations**: The topics derived from LDA can be used in content-based recommendation systems, where restaurants are recommended based on the similarity of their review topics to a user's preferences.

- **Trend Analysis**: Over time, topic modeling can be used to track changes in customer preferences and trends in the restaurant industry.

## Recommendation Systems

In the Yelp Explorer project, three distinct recommendation systems were developed to enhance the user experience in discovering restaurants in Philadelphia. Each system uses a unique approach, leveraging the rich dataset from Yelp reviews and business information.

1. **Location-Based Recommendation System**
2. **Collaborative Filtering Recommendation System**
3. **Content-Based Recommendation System**

  - **User-Item Matrix**: Created a matrix with users as rows and restaurants as columns, populated with Prime Scores from user reviews.
  - **Matrix Normalization**: Normalized the ratings by centering them around the mean.
  - **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**: Applied SVD, a matrix factorization technique, to decompose the user-item matrix, extracting latent features that capture hidden user preferences and restaurant characteristics.
  - **Prediction of Ratings**: Reconstructed the user-item matrix using the decomposed matrices to predict missing ratings, enabling the system to suggest restaurants that a user might prefer based on their historical preferences and those of similar users.
  - **Cosine Similarity**: Utilized cosine similarity to measure the similarity between different users based on their rating patterns.
- **Application**: The system identifies users with similar tastes and recommends restaurants liked by these similar users, thus personalizing suggestions based on collaborative preferences.

#### Content-Based Recommendation System

- **Objective**: To recommend restaurants by matching their features with user preferences.
- **Implementation Details**:
  - **Keyword Extraction**: Employed Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to process and extract relevant keywords from restaurant categories and reviews.
  - **Bag of Words Model**: Created a 'Bag of Words' for each restaurant by aggregating its extracted keywords, which effectively summarizes its unique characteristics.
  - **Vectorization**: Applied `CountVectorizer` to transform the bag of words into a numerical format, creating a count matrix that represents the frequency of each word.
  - **Cosine Similarity**: Calculated the cosine similarity between different restaurants based on their count matrices. This metric measures the similarity in their keyword profiles, indicating how closely related the restaurants are in terms of content.
- **Application**: The system suggests restaurants that have similar keyword profiles to those preferred by the user, ensuring recommendations are closely aligned with the user’s tastes in terms of cuisine, ambiance, and other specific preferences.

Each recommendation system in the Yelp Explorer project serves a unique purpose: the location-based system focuses on geographical convenience, the collaborative filtering system leverages shared user preferences, and the content-based system aligns with individual tastes based on restaurant features.
